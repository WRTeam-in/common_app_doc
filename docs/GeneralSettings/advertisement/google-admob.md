## 2.1 App Validation & app-ads.txt Setup

Proper validation and `app-ads.txt` configuration ensure your app is authorized to serve ads and earn revenue.

### App Validation

#### For Published Apps

If your app is already live on the **Google Play Store** or **Apple App Store**:

- AdMob will **automatically validate your app** once the SDK is integrated and users start using the app.
- No manual steps are needed.
- You can monitor the validation status in the [AdMob Console](https://apps.admob.com) under "Apps" > "App settings".

> **Tip:** Make sure the app includes the correct App ID and Ad Unit IDs in the SDK initialization code.

---

#### For Unpublished Apps

If your app is **not yet published**, you must trigger validation manually:

1. **Complete SDK Integration:**

   - Follow the integration steps for Android (using `AndroidManifest.xml`) or iOS (using `Info.plist`) as shown in Section 4.

2. **Use a Real Device:**

   - Install your app (debug or release) on a real physical device (not an emulator).
   - Launch the app and keep it open for a few seconds.

3. **Wait for Validation:**

   - Google will detect that your app has initialized the AdMob SDK.
   - App status in the AdMob dashboard should change from **"Not yet validated"** to **"Ready to serve ads"** within a few hours.

4. **Verify in Console:**
   - In the [AdMob Console](https://apps.admob.com), check your app status under "Apps".
   - If validation is successful, you'll see a message like **"SDK detected"**.

> **Important:** Use **test ads** during validation to avoid any policy violations.

### Configuring `app-ads.txt` for Authorized Sellers

To prevent unauthorized ad inventory sales and improve ad revenue, configure the `app-ads.txt` file.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Generate Your File:**

   - Go to [AdMob Console > Apps > App Settings](https://apps.admob.com)
   - Click **"Download app-ads.txt"**
   - It will look something like:
     ```
     google.com, pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0
     ```

2. **Host the File on Your Website:**
   - Upload the `app-ads.txt` file to the **root directory** of your developer website (e.g.):
     ```
     https://yourdomain.com/app-ads.txt
     ```

---

### Linking Your Website in App Stores

#### Google Play Console

1. Go to **Google Play Console > All apps > Your App > Store Presence > Store Settings**
2. In **"Developer Website"**, add the full domain:

   ```
   https://yourdomain.com
   ```

3. Save and publish the changes.

#### Apple App Store Connect

1. Go to **App Store Connect > Your App > App Information**
2. In **Marketing URL**, enter:

   ```
   https://yourdomain.com
   ```

3. Save and submit for review.

---

### Validate Your `app-ads.txt` File

After publishing:

- Go back to AdMob Console > **"App settings"**
- Under **"App-ads.txt status"**, ensure it shows as **"Authorized"**
- If not, double-check:
- The file is accessible: `https://yourdomain.com/app-ads.txt`
- The domain matches the one in Play Store / App Store

> **Note:** Validation can take up to 24â€“48 hours to reflect in the console.

2. In the App settings page, look for the "App ID" field
3. This ID starts with "ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX~YYYYYYYYYY"
4. Copy this ID for later use in your app integration

## 4. Implementing AdMob in Your App

### For Android Integration:

1. Open your project's `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file
2. Find the `<meta-data>` tag inside the `<application>` tag, as shown in the example below.

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
    android:value="ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX~YYYYYYYYYY" />
```

3. Replace "ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX~YYYYYYYYYY" with your actual Android App ID

### For iOS Integration:

1. Open your project's `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file
2. Find the `<key>GADApplicationIdentifier</key>` tag inside the `<dict>` tag, as shown in the example below.

```xml
<key>GADApplicationIdentifier</key>
<string>ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX~YYYYYYYYYY</string>
```

3. Replace "ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX~YYYYYYYYYY" with your actual iOS App ID
