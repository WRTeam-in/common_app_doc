# App Icon Setup

## üìå Understanding App Icons

App icons are platform-specific image files responsible for displaying your app‚Äôs icon on a device after installation. Both **Android** and **iOS** have their own icon requirements, ensuring proper visibility across different screen sizes and resolutions.

To update the app icon, you can:
1. **Manually replace icon resources** in the Android and iOS directories.
2. **Use a package** to automate icon generation.

## üîß Automated Method (Recommended)

Use the **Flutter Launcher Icons** package to generate icons easily.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Add Dependency

Include the following in your `pubspec.yaml` under `dev_dependencies`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_launcher_icons: any
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Icons

Add the following configuration in `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
flutter_launcher_icons:
  android: "ic_launcher"
  ios: true
  remove_alpha_ios: true
  image_path: "assets/images/ic_launcher.png"
```

#### üîπ Optional Adaptive Icon Settings (Android Only)
For Android **adaptive icons**, you can add:

```yaml
  adaptive_icon_foreground: "assets/images/ic_launcher_adaptive.png"
  adaptive_icon_background: "#FFFFFF"
  adaptive_icon_monochrome: "assets/images/ic_launcher_monochrome.png"
  adaptive_icon_foreground_inset: 16
```

### üîç Explanation of Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `image_path` | **(Required)** Main icon file (512x512 recommended) for both Android and iOS. |
| `ios` | `true` to generate iOS icons, `false` to skip. |
| `remove_alpha_ios` | `true` removes the alpha layer from iOS icons for store upload. |
| `android` | Icon name inside Android `res` folder. |
| `adaptive_icon_foreground` | **(Optional)** Transparent PNG (512x512 or any size) for adaptive icon foreground. |
| `adaptive_icon_background` | **(Optional)** Background color of adaptive icon. |
| `adaptive_icon_monochrome` | **(Optional)** Monochrome icon (black/transparent) for notifications and Android 13+ themed icons. |
| `adaptive_icon_foreground_inset` | **(Optional)** Padding for adaptive icon (default: `16`). |

**Note:** If using **adaptive icons**, ensure the asset paths are registered under `assets` in `pubspec.yaml`.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Icons

Run the following command to apply changes:

```sh
dart run flutter_launcher_icons
```

![appicon](../../static/img/appicon/appicon1.png)

üîπ **Tip:** Delete any existing icons with different shapes to prevent conflicts.

‚úÖ After running this command, your app will have updated icons across Android and iOS!
